In this task, the Head of the Analytics Unit asks you to use the collected dataset to do a 3-class (Mirai-greip_flood, Recon-OSScan, DictionaryBruteForce) intrusion type classification to help understand the behavior of attacks. As you will see, this dataset is highly complicated and includes a lot of features that make this problem more challenging.

 Your tasks include:

understanding the specifics of the dataset; 
extracting information about each of the attributes, possible associations between them, and any other specifics of the dataset.
